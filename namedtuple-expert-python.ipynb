    "In this example, we've only saved ourself a few lines of code because we had to write a wrapper function. It's clear to see that the advantage to using `namedtuple` grows when we use more data objects. Conceptually, our code is cleaner because we've stripped out the boilerplate and repetition. \n",

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "  + You can save yourself a lot of code if your project is filled with data objects.\n",
    "  + Named tuples show their intent. If you are using one, its fully clear your object isn't meant to do anything, It's just here hold data and by used by other code. If you create a class, it's more ambigious. Your object could hold a little data here and do a little computing there, and the user will have to look at the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    " - Named Tuples aren't as commonly used as classes, so some pythonistas reading your code may have to learn a new concept to understand your work. This isn't too bad, because it's a pretty lightweight concept.\n",
    " - Handling default values is a bit ugly with namedtuple, though if you are doing it often, you could wrap the light uglyness in a function."
